Can base conversion on this http://oralhistory.library.ucla.edu/technology/XML/simpleTEIp5.xml


Should use <rs> and <name> with the attributes @type and, if needed, @subtype for all references, to refer back to our key. 
	-think we should use @key for this. 
	-<rs> if it is referring string; <name> if they explicitly state the name. We can 	do a general conversion to <rs>, but these should then be proofread and changed to 	<name> when applicable. 
	-Epithets would probably be <rs> with @type the kind of referent, and @subtype as 	epithet. 

Refer here for clear outline about how to do names, dates, places. http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html

Could possibly use <gap> to do pauses in the speech. Used for omissions really, but might be able to use as a pause.
