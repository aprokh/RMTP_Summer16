We divided interviews into two groups (female and male interviewees)  and analyzed the frequency of mentioning of specific genres by female and male interviewees.  

For our analysis we used collection of interviews on Obdurodon server and xquery FLOWR expression

xquery version "3.0";
let $index := doc('/db/course/rmtp/index.xml')
let $interviews := collection('/db/course/rmtp/data')/interview[.//interviewee/@ref = $index//person[.//gender/text()='f']/@xml:id]
let $distinctGenres := distinct-values($interviews//genre/@ref)
for $distinctGenre in $distinctGenres
let $countInterviews := count($interviews//body[.//genre/@ref = $distinctGenre])
where $countInterviews gt 1
return concat($distinctGenre, " occurs in ", $countInterviews, "interview(s).")

We used the data to build bar graphs representing how many interviews by female and male interviewees mention genres more than once in the interviews.

There are two ways to read these bar graphs.
First, we can look at the points of differences and convergence between genre preferences.  Both male and female interviewees favor comedy as their favorite genre.  The rest of the favorite genres differ.  
Second we can examine the range of genres that male and female interviewees favor.  The range of genres di
