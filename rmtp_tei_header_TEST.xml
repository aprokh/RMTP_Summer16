            way I would use an @type attribute, which is permitted on date, so I've just applied it here. 
            Will that work for you? See the element specifications for date here:

            <!--2016-07-09 ebb: To make this valid inside biblFull, I wrapped your note element in a notesStmt element. This is a good place to put an abstract. I don't think you need the @type="abstract" here UNLESS you intend to include other kinds of notes here. You *can* do that, and have multiple notes inside the notesStmt, like this:
           
           <notesStmt>
              <note type="abstract">ABSTRACT HERE</note>
              <note type="somethingElse">SOMETHING ELSE RELEVANT HERE THAT IS NOT AN ABSTRACT</note>

  My guess is that you don't need that, so if you only ever have one type of note in this biblFull, just go without an attribute to simplify things.

      <!--2016-07-09 ebb: Instead of encodingDesc + projectDesc, I'd suggest using profileDesc instead, given your content here. It will make your metadata more searchable, and your content here seems more consistent with a profile description in the TEI than an encoding description. The profile description in TEI tells us something more than a bibliography can about your project, so it's meant to help capture its "profile" if you will! The encodingDesc is really more about explaining your approach to coding and markup in particular. The challenge of profileDesc, though, is that you need more specific tags than the generic <p> for paragraph. I'll add some here as suggestions, but read more about profileDesc here:

      <profileDesc><abstract><!--2016-07-09 ebb: I'd move this up to the publicationStmt: RUSSIAN MOVIE THEATER PROJECT.--> <p>The Russian Movie Theater Project is an archive and a study of film exhibition in St. Petersburg during the twentieth century: a portrait of film exhibition and movie-going scene in Soviet Leningrad and Post-Soviet St. Petersburg. The project is inspired by Williamsburg Theater Project (led by Professor Arthur Knight) and the international initiative, the History of Moviegoing, Exhibition, and Reception (HOMER) Project. While many Western cinematic traditions are represented in the HOMER project, there is no online archive covering Russian cinema. The RMTP aims to fill that gap.</p>
           <p>Most histories of Russian and Soviet cinema operate under the assumption that all films released were available to all citizens of Russia Soviet Union. When the films received a limited release for political reasons, researchers provide anecdotal evidence about how these films were distributed. The Russian Movie Theater Project would like to create an empirical portrait of Russians’ movie going habits and film exhibition patterns at different periods of Soviet and Russian history. For example, when and where Soviets were able to see Western films in Stalinist Russia? How did the availability of Italian, Indian, and American films changed after Stalin’s death? How does Soviet-era propaganda and post-Soviet promotion affect film distribution and film attendance? Using computational tools, this Project examines oral history interviews, in which interviewees reconstruct their moviegoing experiences in St. Petersburg, Russia.  To see the computational module of the project click here. Specifically, the Project analyzes</p>
           
          <list> <item>what moviegoers remember (films, actors, directors),</item>
           <item>how they evaluate films, actors, characters,</item>
           <item>how they define themsleves as narrators (I or we),</item> 
             <item>what they hesitate about when they recollect their moviegoing experiences,</item>
           <item>and how their cinematic experiences shape their identities as Soviets, Russians, and global citizens.</item></list></abstract>
