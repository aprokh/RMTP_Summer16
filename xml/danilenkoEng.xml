            haven’t been in a modern <place ref="movieTheater">movie theater</place>, because in
            connection with work, with <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> profession, there
            just isn’t time to go. But <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> first
            impression<hes type="nonlex"/>…what <epit ref="kino">a huge building</epit> <epit ref="kino">with big seats</epit>, something very enjoyable, something new,
            it wasn’t quite a house. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> didn’t have a TV set
            then, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> didn’t know what that was. But of course
            it was very, very enjoyable. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When did you start going to the movies by yourself? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was<hes type="nonlex"/>…<hes type="lex">well</hes>, <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> didn’t go alone, only sometime around sixteen, when <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> was sixteen years old. <hes ref="lex">Surely</hes> only then. And even so <pron
                type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> went together to the movie theater. With school.
            Or there was a showing for us at school, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had a
            not too big movie room. They showed them to us there or <pron type="pers" number="plur"

        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How often did you go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Not very often. <hes type="lex">Maybe</hes> once a month or once every

        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How did your habit of going to the movies change
            when you grew up? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It changed profoundly. When <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> was a kid, and when I, <hes type="lex">well</hes>, became a teenager and then
            already a full-grown adult<hes type="nonlex"/>…Earlier cinema was more accessible to the <collective>people</collective>, it was
            accessible for the <collective>people</collective>. It was just more full of life, not like today. Now these
            films like <genre ref="blockbuster">blockbusters</genre>, everything is very <epit ref="blockbuster">strange</epit> and

            They became classics. Or <title ref="ivanVasilevichChangesJobs">Ivan Vasilievich Changes
                his Profession</title>. You too <hes ref="lex">surely</hes> know it. They’re really <epit ref="diamondArm">interesting</epit> and

        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you have favorite actors and actresses? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes, of course. They were and still remain,

        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why were they your favorite actors? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know why<hes type="nonlex"/>…watching them at the movies, you, <hes type="lex">maybe</hes> how you experienced the role that they
            were playing together with them. And it was very interesting, how they acted. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Could you repeat the question? </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Outing to the <place ref="movieTheater">movie

            was a <epit ref="elusiveAvengers">revolutionary</epit> film. There young boys played the roles. A young girl and young
            boys. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really liked that. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know. <hes type="lex">Maybe</hes> they had such adventurous topics, perhaps because <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> were about the same age. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember a screening on television, a movie

            <epit ref="swanLake">really, really beautiful</epit>. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> liked the music in
            the show. And <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really liked the girls, who were
            acting. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was really little then. The first time
                <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> saw it. There were in really pretty
            dresses, in tutus<hes type="nonlex"/>…they were all white, so unusual. It was that, probably, that left such
            a strong impression on me. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> really, really liked
            ballet. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember when you saw it? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was probably 1959. </speech>

        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            had a lot. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> lived in, how can one say this<hes type="nonlex"/>…such
            a little village, like in the countryside. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had

            helped <pron type="poss" number="plur">our</pron> parents. <pron type="pers"
                number="plur">we</pron> had a lot of animals. <pron type="pers" number="plur"
                >we</pron> took care of them, fed them. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            read books. There, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had vacation in the
            summertime. After school <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> were off for three
            months. <hes type="lex">Well</hes> and they absolutely gave us a big assignment in school, in order for us to
            ready many books over the summer. <hes type="lex">Well</hes> whatever, <pron type="pers" number="sing"

                number="sing">my</pron> brother. And then <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            would go with <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> friends. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there more men or women at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">No, it was really equal. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did people often go to the movies with their
            families or with their friends/girlfriends? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t
            know. How to say<hes type="nonlex"/>…it was generally different, <hes type="lex">maybe</hes> you went one tie with your friends,
            then another time with family. Parents with their kids. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there lines at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes, there were lines. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember waiting in line? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">What kind of movie? <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> remember <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was
            studying in <place ref="volgograd">Volgograd</place>, and <pron type="pers"
                number="sing">I</pron> went with <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> friend.
            The film was called <title ref="womanWhoSings">The Woman Who Sings</title>. <pron
                type="poss" number="plur">our</pron> <epit ref="pugacheva">famous singer</epit> <person ref="pugacheva">Alla
                Borisovna Pugacheva</person> starred in that movie. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Why did you like it? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, how. She became a famous singer and a new
            movie came out. <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> really like seeing and
            listening to her new songs and seeing her not like a singer, but like an actress. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you know people who worked at the movie
            theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">At the <place ref="movieTheater">movie
                theater</place><hes type="nonlex"/>…probably not. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How was the atmosphere in the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">What was it like in the screening room? With how
            the kids behaved, who came to the movies? It depended on the film they were showing,
            they shouted, clapped. But when it was quiet, someone cried. What a topic there was in
            the movie, if it was sad. When it was funny, everyone laughed. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you eat anything at the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">No. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            think that wasn’t permitted. If a person came to watch a film, that meant that all his
            attention had to be turned to the screen, and he had to watch, and not snack. There was
            another place for that. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">But there was food service in the movie theater? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Other people ate? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, sometimes. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">What did they eat? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, something there. Pies, sandwiches. What
            they sold. Lemonade – like you have Coca Cola, Peps<pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> Cola, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> have lemonade. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">And ice cream? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            didn’t have ice cream. It was like that only in the city, they only seldom brought us
            ice cream in the store. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did you watch foreign movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Foreign ones? Yes <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> watched foreign movies. <hes type="lex">Well</hes>, and like today with <pron type="poss"

            a lot of<hes type="nonlex"/>…some sort of violence and murder there. <hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <hes type="lex">maybe</hes> it’s like that, <pron
                type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know. I’m somehow closer to <pron

            <epit ref="alexander and spartacus and troy">striking</epit> movies. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you like historical films? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Yes. They’re really good. <title ref="gladiator"
                >Gladiator</title>, although in these movies, of course, very many of their plots
            are also tragic. But the movies are very interesting. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When did you see this movie? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes><hes type="nonlex"/>…it was last year <pron type="pers"

        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Were there movies you weren’t allowed to go to? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, yes. With us it was forbidden, they
            wouldn’t let you go up until sixteen. The movie theater only until four o’clock. And
            there they showed only <genre ref="childrens">children’s films</genre>. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Your parents didn’t let you go or the movie
            theater’s administration? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, the administration, and the school, but
                <pron type="poss" number="sing">my</pron> parents too, how to say<hes type="nonlex"/>…they didn’t forbid
            it. At nine o’clock <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> had to come home if <pron
                type="pers" number="plur">we</pron> were out. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Yes. Did you try to go out, to a film you weren’t
            allowed to go to? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="plur">We</pron> tried,
            but they didn’t let us in. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you remember any film that had problems coming
            to the screen? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            don’t know, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> can’t say that<hes type="nonlex"/>…<hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <hes type="lex">maybe</hes> the
            censor forbade some films. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Excuse me? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">It was like that before, there was a commission.
            They, when a film was ready, it was supposed to come to the big screen at the <place
                ref="movieTheater">movie theater</place>, they watched it and gave their decision,
            whether it was okay or not. <hes type="lex">Well</hes> <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> don’t know. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Did your parents go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">They went, but very rarely, when there was time. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">What did they watch when they went? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, different kinds of movies that were <pron
                type="poss" number="plur">our</pron>
            <genre ref="classics">classics</genre>, and <genre ref="comedy">comedies</genre>, <hes type="lex">well</hes>
            foreign films, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> can’t say their names now,
            because <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> was very little. <hes type="lex">Well</hes>, whatever was at
            the <place ref="movieTheater">movie theater</place>, they tried when they were able to
            go to the <place ref="movieTheater">movie theater</place> to see, and they were
            interested in finding out how another country lived. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">Do you still go to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> would
            like to, but only if there were time and the opportunity, of course. But now, when there
            is time, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> watch movies on television. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">How and why did your experiences of movie theaters
            change? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a"><hes type="lex">Well</hes>, <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            haven’t been in a contemporary movie theater. Like <pron type="pers" number="sing"
                >I</pron> don’t know now<hes type="nonlex"/>…what there is and stereo movies, different screening halls.
            Before there was just a typical screening hall with chairs and a big screen. Of course,
            the first impression was atypical for us when <pron type="pers" number="plur">we</pron>
            went to the movies, but it was very enjoyable. <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron>
            can’t compare today, because <pron type="pers" number="sing">I</pron> haven’t been in a
            new theater. You could ask the younger generation though. </speech>
        <speech speaker="roberts" speechtype="q">When was the last time when you went to the movies? </speech>
        <speech speaker="danilenko" speechtype="a">Oy, the last time, huh? <hes type="lex">Well</hes>, ten years ago.
