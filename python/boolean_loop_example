#compare a String to an int and you will get an error (you can try getting rid of
#the int() function and check out the error message.)

#(while boolean == False). Basic logic is that it takes new input for int2 each
#time, and then tests if its greater than int1. When this is true, the if block
#is executed, and it sets boolean variable to True. Thus, the next time it comes
#to the while block, it passes it over becasue boolean != False.
