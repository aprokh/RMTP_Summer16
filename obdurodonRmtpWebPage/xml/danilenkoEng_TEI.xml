            <authority>Russian Movie Theater Project <bloc>The Russian Movie Theater Project
                            is an archive and a study of film exhibition in St. Petersburg during
                            the twentieth century: a portrait of film exhibition and movie-going
                            scene in Soviet Leningrad and Post-Soviet St. Petersburg. The project is
                            inspired by Williamsburg Theater Project (led by Professor Arthur
                            Knight) and the international initiative, the History of Moviegoing,
                            Exhibition, and Reception (HOMER) Project. While many Western cinematic
                            traditions are represented in the HOMER project, there is no online
                            archive covering Russian cinema. The RMTP aims to fill that gap. Most
                            histories of Russian and Soviet cinema operate under the assumption that
                            all films released were available to all citizens of Russia Soviet
                            Union. When the films received a limited release for political reasons,
                            researchers provide anecdotal evidence about how these films were
                            distributed. The Russian Movie Theater Project would like to create an
                            empirical portrait of Russians’ movie going habits and film exhibition
                            patterns at different periods of Soviet and Russian history. For
                            example, when and where Soviets were able to see Western films in
                            Stalinist Russia? How did the availability of Italian, Indian, and
                            American films changed after Stalin’s death? How does Soviet-era
                            propaganda and post-Soviet promotion affect film distribution and film
                            attendance? Using computational tools, this Project examines oral
                            history interviews, in which interviewees reconstruct their moviegoing
                            experiences in St. Petersburg, Russia. To see the computational module
                            of the project click here. Specifically, the Project analyzes what
                            moviegoers remember (films, actors, directors), how they evaluate films,
                            actors, characters, how they define themsleves as narrators (I or we),
                            what they hesitate about when they recollect their moviegoing
                            experiences, and how their cinematic experiences shape their identities
                            as Soviets, Russians, and global citizens. </bloc>

                tale film</rs>. It was a version for kids, that all of life is a fairy tale, oh
            so beautiful. Those were the first impressions. </u>

            <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs>
            haven’t been in a modern <rs type="place" key="movieTheater">movie theater</rs>, because in

            just isn’t time to go. But <rs type="pron" subtype="possSing">my</rs> first

            <rs type="epit" key="kino">with big seats</rs>, something very enjoyable, something new,
            it wasn’t quite a house. <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> didn’t have a TV set
            then, <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> didn’t know what that was. But of course
            it was very, very enjoyable. </u>
        <u xml:id="sp19" who="roberts">When did you start going to the movies by yourself? </u>
        <u xml:id="sp20" who="danilenko">It was<span type="nonlex"/>…<span type="lex">well</span>, <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> didn’t go alone, only sometime around sixteen, when <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> was sixteen years old. <span type="nonlex"/> only then. And even so <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> went together to the movie theater. With school.
            Or there was a showing for us at school, <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> had a
            not too big movie room. They showed them to us there or <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> went in a group to the <rs type="place" key="movieTheater">movie theater</rs>. </u>

        <u xml:id="sp23" who="roberts">How often did you go to the movies? </u>
        <u xml:id="sp24" who="danilenko">Not very often. <span type="lex">Maybe</span> once a month or once every
            two months. Because it was such an expensive treat <span type="nonlex"/>… </u>
        <u xml:id="sp25" who="roberts">How did your habit of going to the movies change
            when you grew up? </u>
        <u xml:id="sp26" who="danilenko">It changed profoundly. When <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> was a kid, and when I, <span type="lex">well</span>, became a teenager and then
            already a full-grown adult <span type="nonlex"/>… Earlier cinema was more accessible to the people, it was
            accessible for the people. It was just more full of life, not like today. Now these
            films like <rs type="genre" key="blockbuster">blockbusters</rs>, everything is very <rs type="epit" key="blockbuster">strange</rs> and
            <rs type="epit" key="blockbuster">a bit incomprehensible</rs>. </u>
        <u xml:id="sp27" who="roberts">What were your favorite genres in childhood? </u>
        <u xml:id="sp28" who="danilenko">As a child, <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> think it was <rs type="genre" key="skazka">fairy tales</rs> and those educational
            programs. <rs type="title" key="inTheAnimalWorld">In the World of Animals</rs>, <rs type="pron" subtype="persPlur">we</rs> had a show like that, and many, many people

            <rs type="pron" subtype="possPlur">Our</rs> classics. But not just one, <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> think there are
            very many, the films of <rs type="person" key="gaidai">Gaidai</rs>, <rs type="title" key="diamondArm">The Diamond Arm</rs>
            <span type="nonlex"/>…and others. </u>

        <u xml:id="sp32" who="danilenko">They’re <rs type="genre" key="comedy">comedies</rs>.
            They became classics. Or <rs type="title" key="ivanVasilevichChangesJobs">Ivan Vasilievich Changes

            know why<span type="nonlex"/>… watching them at the movies, you, <span type="lex">maybe</span> how you experienced the role that they were playing together with them. And it was very interesting, how they acted. </u>
        <u xml:id="sp37" who="roberts">Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </u>

            <rs type="pron" subtype="persSing">I</rs> don’t

        <u xml:id="sp64" who="danilenko">What was it like in the screening room? With how
            the kids behaved, who came to the movies? It depended on the film they were showing,

            think that wasn’t permitted. If a person came to watch a film, that meant that all his
