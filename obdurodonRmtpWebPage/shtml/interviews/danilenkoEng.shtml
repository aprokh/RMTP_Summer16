         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> was born

         <p>Do you remember the first time you went to the

         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>It was a long time ago. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> when <span class="persSing">I</span> was five. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember the movie you went to see? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>It was a <span class="genre">fairy tale</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Could you please explain the movie? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>The impression from watching the movie or its
            plot? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>About the experiences. </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>About the experiences. The sensation<span class="nonLex">...</span>…it was a
            long time ago, it really was. The first big screen at <span class="place">the
               movies</span> for me was something unusual. Some sort of <span class="genre">fairy
               tale film</span>. It was a version for kids, that all of life is a fairy tale, oh
            so beautiful. Those were the first impressions. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Who did you go with? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>With <span class="possSing">my</span>
            mom. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did you like the movie theater? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span> 
            <span class="persSing">I</span>
            haven’t been in a modern <span class="place">movie theater</span>, because in
            connection with work, with <span class="possSing">my</span> profession, there
            just isn’t time to go. But <span class="possSing">my</span> first
            impression<span class="nonLex">...</span>…what <span class="epit">a huge building</span> 
            <span class="epit">with big seats</span>, something very enjoyable, something new,
            it wasn’t quite a house. <span class="persPlur">we</span> didn’t have a TV set
            then, <span class="persPlur">we</span> didn’t know what that was. But of course
            it was very, very enjoyable. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>When did you start going to the movies by yourself? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>It was<span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="lex">well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span> didn’t go alone, only sometime around sixteen, when <span class="persSing">I</span> was sixteen years old. <span class="nonLex">...</span> only then. And even so <span class="persPlur">we</span> went together to the movie theater. With school.
            Or there was a showing for us at school, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a
            not too big movie room. They showed them to us there or <span class="persPlur">we</span> went in a group to the <span class="place">movie theater</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you like going to the movies? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> liked
            it, of course <span class="persSing">I</span> liked it. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How often did you go to the movies? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>Not very often. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> once a month or once every
            two months. Because it was such an expensive treat <span class="nonLex">...</span>… 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did your habit of going to the movies change
            when you grew up? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>It changed profoundly. When <span class="persSing">I</span> was a kid, and when I, <span class="lex">well</span>, became a teenager and then
            already a full-grown adult <span class="nonLex">...</span>… Earlier cinema was more accessible to the people, it was
            accessible for the people. It was just more full of life, not like today. Now these
            films like <span class="genre">blockbusters</span>, everything is very <span class="epit">strange</span> and
            <span class="epit">a bit incomprehensible</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>What were your favorite genres in childhood? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>As a child, <span class="persSing">I</span> think it was <span class="genre">fairy tales</span> and those educational
            programs. <span class="title">In the World of Animals</span>, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a show like that, and many, many people
            watched it. <span class="genre">Documentaries</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you have a favorite movie? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="possPlur">Our</span> classics. But not just one, <span class="persSing">I</span> think there are
            very many, the films of <span class="person">Gaidai</span>, <span class="title">The Diamond Arm</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…and others. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Explain the movies, please. </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>They’re <span class="genre">comedies</span>.
            They became classics. Or <span class="title">Ivan Vasilievich Changes
               his Profession</span>. You too <span class="nonLex">...</span> know it. They’re really <span class="epit">interesting</span> and
            <span class="epit">about real life</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you have favorite actors and actresses? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>Yes, of course. They were and still remain,
            although they’re not still alive. <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="person">Eugene Leonov</span>. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why were they your favorite actors? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know why<span class="nonLex">...</span>… watching them at the movies, you, <span class="lex">maybe</span> how you experienced the role that they were playing together with them. And it was
            very interesting, how they acted. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>Could you repeat the question? </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>Outing to the <span class="place">movie
               theater</span>? That was a long time ago. <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know. Many different films, and the <span class="genre">classics</span>, and <span class="genre">war movies</span>. <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked them as a kid. <span class="persPlur">We</span> also had <span class="title">The Elusive Avengers</span>, it
            was a <span class="epit">revolutionary</span> film. There young boys played the roles. A young girl and young
            boys. <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked that. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> they had such adventurous topics, perhaps because <span class="persPlur">we</span> were about the same age. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember a screening on television, a movie
            on television? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…the first movie, no<span class="nonLex">...</span>…Yes. The first movie,
            probably, <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know, but <span class="persSing">I</span> remember <span class="persSing">I</span> saw the
            ballet <span class="title">Swan Lake</span> on TV. But that was <span class="epit">something fabulous</span>. It was
            <span class="epit">really, really beautiful</span>. <span class="persSing">I</span> liked the music in
            the show. And <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked the girls, who were
            acting. <span class="persSing">I</span> was really little then. The first time
            <span class="persSing">I</span> saw it. There were in really pretty
            dresses, in tutus<span class="nonLex">...</span>…they were all white, so unusual. It was that, probably, that left such
            a strong impression on me. <span class="persSing">I</span> really, really liked
            ballet. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember when you saw it? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>It was probably 1959. </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did you spend your free time, apart from going
            to the movies? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a lot. <span class="persSing">I</span> lived in, how can one say this<span class="nonLex">...</span>…such
            a little village, like in the countryside. <span class="persPlur">we</span> had
            so many chores around the house, so much work. <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            helped <span class="possPlur">our</span> parents. <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a lot of animals. <span class="persPlur">we</span> took care of them, fed them. <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            read books. There, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had vacation in the
            summertime. After school <span class="persPlur">we</span> were off for three
            months. <span class="lex">Well</span> and they absolutely gave us a big assignment in school, in order for us to
            ready many books over the summer. <span class="lex">Well</span> whatever, <span class="persSing">I</span> really like to read. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Who did you usually go to the movies with? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, when <span class="persSing">I</span> was little, with <span class="possSing">my</span> mom or with
            <span class="possSing">my</span> older sister or <span class="possSing">my</span> brother. And then <span class="persSing">I</span>
            would go with <span class="possSing">my</span> friends. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Were there more men or women at the movie theater? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>No, it was really equal. </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did people often go to the movies with their
            families or with their friends/girlfriends? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know. How to say<span class="nonLex">...</span>…it was generally different, <span class="lex">maybe</span> you went one tie with your friends,
            then another time with family. Parents with their kids. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Were there lines at the movie theater? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>Yes, there were lines. </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember waiting in line? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>What kind of movie? <span class="persSing">I</span> remember <span class="persSing">I</span> was
            studying in <span class="place">Volgograd</span>, and <span class="persSing">I</span> went with <span class="possSing">my</span> friend.
            The film was called <span class="title">The Woman Who Sings</span>. <span class="possPlur">our</span> 
            <span class="epit">famous singer</span> 
            <span class="person">Alla
               Borisovna Pugacheva</span> starred in that movie. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why did you like it? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, how. She became a famous singer and a new
            movie came out. <span class="persPlur">we</span> really like seeing and
            listening to her new songs and seeing her not like a singer, but like an actress.
            
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you know people who worked at the movie
            theater? 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>At the <span class="place">movie
               theater</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…probably not. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How was the atmosphere in the movie theater? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>What was it like in the screening room? With how
            the kids behaved, who came to the movies? It depended on the film they were showing,
            they shouted, clapped. But when it was quiet, someone cried. What a topic there was
            in
            the movie, if it was sad. When it was funny, everyone laughed. 
         </p>
         
         <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you eat anything at the movie theater? </p>
         
         <h3>Danilenko: </h3>
         <p>No. <span class="persSing">I</span>
            think that wasn’t permitted. If a person came to watch a film, that meant that all
            his
            attention had to be turned to the screen, and he had to watch, and not snack. There
            was

            Before there was just a typical screening hall with chairs and a big screen. Of course,
