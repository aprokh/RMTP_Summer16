        <h1>Qualitative Analysis and Conclusions</h1>
        <p> Computational methods allowed us to discover patterns in research questions of this
            particular corpus of interviews For example, 88 distinct titles were mentioned in the
            interviews. However, there is an interesting disconnect between genres and specific
            titles. Several interviewees mention European art cinema and specific directors, such as
            Fellini, Antonioni, Bertolucci, yet they do not mention any specific film titles.
            Rather, these names appear as repeated lists. One conclusion we draw from this finding
            is that these names serve as an affirmation of cultural taste and a shared “cultured”
            identity, not a memorable individual experience of watching a film. The same
            interviewees list specific titles of popular culture films. </p>
        <p>Massive data mining allowed us to see larger patterns, especially in network analysis
            where co-occurences and paths are impossible for humans to calculate. Likewise, the data
            on the uses of pronouns and hesitation support our hypothesis but also modifies it. (1)
            Collective and plural pronouns are used more often by Soviet generation interviewees. It
            is important to note that currently we have interviews only by female interviewees who
            grew up during the Soviet era. The addition of interviews by male interviewees who grew
            up during the Soviet era might change our conclusions. (2) Hesitation marks are also
            more prominent in the interviews by female interviewees who grew up during the Soviet
            era, but are also contingent on age and remoteness of memories. (3) Their use also
            depends on how extensive the answer is; male responses are usually shorter in our sample
            of interviews. </p>
        <p>Finally, there are some conclusions concerning the nature of oral history data analysis,
            prompting us to go back and look at the context. What kind of stories do the
            interviewees tell influences the language they use? For example, one of the male
            interviewees, Vadim Leventhal, tells a story of taking his friends to a film festival
            and their shock at the Taiwanese film which turned out to be “an art porno.” He does not
            hesitate a single time. The conclusion is that we all have ready-made stories we told
            many times vs. on-the-spot memories that use a very different discourse and more
            hesitation, connective words or pauses. See for example, Irina Leventhal’s interview. </p>

        <h2>The future development of the project.</h2>
        <p>The future of the project is contingent on adding more texts to the corpus of interviews.
            We have 17 interviews to tag, validate and add to our collection for computational
            analysis. We might also want to use linguistic statistical and topic modeling tools to
            analyze the interviews. </p>
