            Liudmila. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Last name and patronymic, please? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Liudmila Vasilievna Danilenko. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>And where were you born? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> was born
            in <span class="place">Volgograd province</span>. And in 1982 <span class="nonLex">...</span>… and from
            1982 on I’ve been living in <span class="place">St.Petersburg</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember the first time you went to the
            movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It was a long time ago. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> when <span class="persSing">I</span> was five. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember the movie you went to see? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It was a <span class="genre">fairy tale</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Could you please explain the movie? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>The impression from watching the movie or its
            plot? </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>About the experiences. </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>About the experiences. The sensation<span class="nonLex">...</span>…it was a
            long time ago, it really was. The first big screen at <span class="place">the
                movies</span> for me was something unusual. Some sort of <span class="genre">fairy
                tale film</span>. It was a version for kids, that all of life is a fairy tale, oh
            so beautiful. Those were the first impressions. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Who did you go with? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>With <span class="possSing">my</span>
            mom. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did you like the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span> 
            <span class="persSing">I</span>
            haven’t been in a modern <span class="place">movie theater</span>, because in
            connection with work, with <span class="possSing">my</span> profession, there
            just isn’t time to go. But <span class="possSing">my</span> first
            impression<span class="nonLex">...</span>…what <span class="epit">a huge building</span> 
            <span class="epit">with big seats</span>, something very enjoyable, something new,
            it wasn’t quite a house. <span class="persPlur">we</span> didn’t have a TV set
            then, <span class="persPlur">we</span> didn’t know what that was. But of course
            it was very, very enjoyable. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>When did you start going to the movies by yourself? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It was<span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="lex">well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span> didn’t go alone, only sometime around sixteen, when <span class="persSing">I</span> was sixteen years old. <span class="lex">Surely</span> only then. And even so <span class="persPlur">we</span> went together to the movie theater. With school.
            Or there was a showing for us at school, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a
            not too big movie room. They showed them to us there or <span class="persPlur">we</span> went in a group to the <span class="place">movie theater</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you like going to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> liked
            it, of course <span class="persSing">I</span> liked it. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How often did you go to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Not very often. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> once a month or once every
            two months. Because it was such an expensive treat <span class="nonLex">...</span>… </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did your habit of going to the movies change
            when you grew up? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It changed profoundly. When <span class="persSing">I</span> was a kid, and when I, <span class="lex">well</span>, became a teenager and then
            already a full-grown adult <span class="nonLex">...</span>… Earlier cinema was more accessible to the <span class="collective">people</span>, it was
            accessible for the <span class="collective">people</span>. It was just more full of life, not like today. Now these
            films like <span class="genre">blockbusters</span>, everything is very <span class="epit">strange</span> and
            <span class="epit">a bit incomprehensible</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>What were your favorite genres in childhood? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>As a child, <span class="persSing">I</span> think it was <span class="genre">fairy tales</span> and those educational
            programs. <span class="title">In the World of Animals</span>, <span class="collective">
               <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            </span> had a show like that, and many, many people
            watched it. <span class="genre">Documentaries</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you have a favorite movie? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="collective">
               <span class="possPlur">Our</span> classics</span>. But not just one, <span class="persSing">I</span> think there are
            very many, the films of <span class="person">Gaidai</span>, <span class="title">The Diamond Arm</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…and others. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Explain the movies, please. </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>They’re <span class="genre">comedies</span>.
            They became classics. Or <span class="title">Ivan Vasilievich Changes
                his Profession</span>. You too <span class="lex">surely</span> know it. They’re really <span class="epit">interesting</span> and
            <span class="epit">about real life</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you have favorite actors and actresses? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes, of course. They were and still remain,
            although they’re not still alive. <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="person">Eugene Leonov</span>. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why were they your favorite actors? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know why<span class="nonLex">...</span>… watching them at the movies, you, <span class="lex">maybe</span> how you experienced the role that they were playing together with them. And it was very interesting, how they acted. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Could you repeat the question? </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any movie or outing concretely? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Outing to the <span class="place">movie
                theater</span>? That was a long time ago. <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know. Many different films, and the <span class="genre">classics</span>, and <span class="genre">war movies</span>. <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked them as a kid. <span class="collective">
               <span class="persPlur">We</span>
            </span> also had <span class="title">The Elusive Avengers</span>, it
            was a <span class="epit">revolutionary</span> film. There young boys played the roles. A young girl and young
            boys. <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked that. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know. <span class="lex">Maybe</span> they had such adventurous topics, perhaps because <span class="persPlur">we</span> were about the same age. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember a screening on television, a movie
            on television? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…the first movie, no<span class="nonLex">...</span>…Yes. The first movie,
            probably, <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know, but <span class="persSing">I</span> remember <span class="persSing">I</span> saw the
            ballet <span class="title">Swan Lake</span> on TV. But that was <span class="epit">something fabulous</span>. It was
            <span class="epit">really, really beautiful</span>. <span class="persSing">I</span> liked the music in
            the show. And <span class="persSing">I</span> really liked the girls, who were
            acting. <span class="persSing">I</span> was really little then. The first time
                <span class="persSing">I</span> saw it. There were in really pretty
            dresses, in tutus<span class="nonLex">...</span>…they were all white, so unusual. It was that, probably, that left such
            a strong impression on me. <span class="persSing">I</span> really, really liked
            ballet. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember when you saw it? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It was probably 1959. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How did you spend your free time, apart from going
            to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="collective">
               <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            </span> had a lot. <span class="persSing">I</span> lived in, how can one say this<span class="nonLex">...</span>…such
            a little village, like in the countryside. <span class="persPlur">we</span> had
            so many chores around the house, so much work. <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            helped <span class="possPlur">our</span> parents. <span class="persPlur">we</span> had a lot of animals. <span class="persPlur">we</span> took care of them, fed them. <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            read books. There, <span class="persPlur">we</span> had vacation in the
            summertime. After school <span class="persPlur">we</span> were off for three
            months. <span class="lex">Well</span> and they absolutely gave us a big assignment in school, in order for us to
            ready many books over the summer. <span class="lex">Well</span> whatever, <span class="persSing">I</span> really like to read. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Who did you usually go to the movies with? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, when <span class="persSing">I</span> was little, with <span class="possSing">my</span> mom or with
                <span class="possSing">my</span> older sister or <span class="possSing">my</span> brother. And then <span class="persSing">I</span>
            would go with <span class="possSing">my</span> friends. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Were there more men or women at the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>No, it was really equal. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did people often go to the movies with their
            families or with their friends/girlfriends? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t
            know. How to say<span class="nonLex">...</span>…it was generally different, <span class="lex">maybe</span> you went one tie with your friends,
            then another time with family. Parents with their kids. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Were there lines at the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes, there were lines. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember waiting in line? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>What kind of movie? <span class="persSing">I</span> remember <span class="persSing">I</span> was
            studying in <span class="place">Volgograd</span>, and <span class="persSing">I</span> went with <span class="possSing">my</span> friend.
            The film was called <span class="title">The Woman Who Sings</span>. <span class="possPlur">our</span> 
            <span class="epit">famous singer</span> 
            <span class="person">Alla
                Borisovna Pugacheva</span> starred in that movie. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Why did you like it? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, how. She became a famous singer and a new
            movie came out. <span class="persPlur">we</span> really like seeing and
            listening to her new songs and seeing her not like a singer, but like an actress. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you know people who worked at the movie
            theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>At the <span class="place">movie
                theater</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…probably not. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How was the atmosphere in the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>What was it like in the screening room? With how
            the kids behaved, who came to the movies? It depended on the film they were showing,
            they shouted, clapped. But when it was quiet, someone cried. What a topic there was in
            the movie, if it was sad. When it was funny, everyone laughed. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you eat anything at the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>No. <span class="persSing">I</span>
            think that wasn’t permitted. If a person came to watch a film, that meant that all his
            attention had to be turned to the screen, and he had to watch, and not snack. There was
            another place for that. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>But there was food service in the movie theater? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Other people ate? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, sometimes. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>What did they eat? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, something there. Pies, sandwiches. What
            they sold. Lemonade – like you have Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, <span class="collective">
               <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            </span> have lemonade. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>And ice cream? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            didn’t have ice cream. It was like that only in the city, <span class="collective">
               <span class="possPlur">they</span>
            </span>  only seldom brought us
            ice cream in the store. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did you watch foreign movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Foreign ones? Yes <span class="persSing">I</span> watched foreign movies. <span class="lex">Well</span>, and like today with <span class="collective">

        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any films you’ve seen? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Foreign ones? <span class="persSing">I</span> can say <span class="title">Spartacus</span>, yours, but <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t remember the director or the actors.
            There’s <span class="title">Alexander</span>, yours, <span class="title">Troy</span>
            and <span class="lex">maybe</span> there’s others, <span class="epit">historical</span> ones like this, of course, these very
            <span class="epit">striking</span> movies. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you like historical films? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes. They’re really good. <span class="title">Gladiator</span>, although in these movies, of course, very many of their plots
            are also tragic. But the movies are very interesting. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>When did you see this movie? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…it was last year <span class="persSing">I</span> saw it. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>And <span class="title">Spartacus</span> also? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>And what movies do you like most of all? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>There’s also foreign comedies. <span class="persSing">I</span> really like ones with <span class="person">Louis de
                Funes</span>. French movies. Where <span class="person">Jean Marais</span>
            plays. He’s already gone. One and the other, they died. <span class="lex">Well</span> Timothy Dalton is still
            making movies. Now I’ll say, <span class="persSing">I</span> saw <span class="title">Jane Eyre</span>. The film’s called <span class="title">Jane
                Eyre</span>. <span class="person">Timothy Dalton</span> plays in the movie. <span class="persSing">I</span> really like it. Him too<span class="nonLex">...</span>…like there’s a not too
            big story there. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>And do you like Timothy Dalton? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Yes. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you have a favorite foreign actor? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>
            <span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="persSing">I</span>
            don’t know. <span class="persSing">I</span> like ones with <span class="person">Mickey Rourke</span>. Rukenhauer? Did <span class="persSing">I</span>
            get his name right? Also, <span class="lex">well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span> could name
            many, there are many good actors. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Were there movies you weren’t allowed to go to? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, yes. With <span class="collective">
               <span class="possPlur">us</span>
            </span> it was forbidden, they
            wouldn’t let you go up until sixteen. The movie theater only until four o’clock. And
            there they showed only <span class="genre">children’s films</span>.</p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Your parents didn’t let you go or the movie
            theater’s administration? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, the administration, and the school, but
                <span class="possSing">my</span> parents too, how to say<span class="nonLex">...</span>…they didn’t forbid
            it. At nine o’clock <span class="persPlur">we</span> had to come home if <span class="persPlur">we</span> were out. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Yes. Did you try to go out, to a film you weren’t
            allowed to go to? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persPlur">We</span> tried,
            but they didn’t let us in. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you remember any film that had problems coming
            to the screen? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span>
            don’t know, <span class="persSing">I</span> can’t say that<span class="nonLex">...</span>…<span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="lex">maybe</span> the
            censor forbade some films. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Excuse me? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>It was like that before, there was a commission.
            They, when a film was ready, it was supposed to come to the big screen at the <span class="place">movie theater</span>, they watched it and gave their decision,
            whether it was okay or not. <span class="lex">Well</span> 
            <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Did your parents go to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>They went, but very rarely, when there was time. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>What did they watch when they went? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, different kinds of movies that were <span class="collective">
               <span class="possPlur">our</span>
               <span class="genre">classics</span>
            </span>, and <span class="genre">comedies</span>, <span class="lex">well</span>
            foreign films, <span class="persSing">I</span> can’t say their names now,
            because <span class="persSing">I</span> was very little. <span class="lex">Well</span>, whatever was at
            the <span class="place">movie theater</span>, they tried when they were able to
            go to the <span class="place">movie theater</span> to see, and they were
            interested in finding out how another country lived. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>Do you still go to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="persSing">I</span> would
            like to, but only if there were time and the opportunity, of course. But now, when there
            is time, <span class="persSing">I</span> watch movies on television. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>How and why did your experiences of movie theaters
            change? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>
            <span class="lex">Well</span>, <span class="persSing">I</span>
            haven’t been in a contemporary movie theater. Like <span class="persSing">I</span> don’t know now<span class="nonLex">...</span>…what there is and stereo movies, different screening halls.
            Before there was just a typical screening hall with chairs and a big screen. Of course,
            the first impression was atypical for us when <span class="persPlur">we</span>
            went to the movies, but it was very enjoyable. <span class="persSing">I</span>
            can’t compare today, because <span class="persSing">I</span> haven’t been in a
            new theater. You could ask the younger generation though. </p>
        <h3>Roberts: </h3>
         <p>When was the last time when you went to the movies? </p>
        <h3>Даниленко: </h3>
         <p>Oy, the last time, huh? <span class="lex">Well</span>, ten years ago.
